## Introduction
Kidney Disease Classification is a project utilizing deep learning techniques to classify Kidney Tumor and Stone diseases from [medical images dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone/). This project leverages the power of Deep Learning, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices, Data Version Control (DVC), and integrates with DagsHub for collaboration and versioning.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop a reliable and efficient deep learning model that can accurately classify kidney Tumor and Stone from medical images. This could include, but is not limited to, identifying different stages of cancer, detecting anomalies in X-rays, or diagnosing skin diseases through dermatological imaging.

## Importance of the Project
- **Enhancing Healthcare**: By providing accurate and quick disease classification, this project aims to significantly improve patient care and diagnostic accuracy.
- **Research and Development**: It serves as a tool for researchers to analyze medical images more effectively, paving the way for new discoveries in the medical field.
- **Educational Value**: This project can be used as a learning platform for students and professionals interested in deep learning and medical image analysis.

## Technical Overview
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Utilizes popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the classification models.
- **Data Version Control (DVC)**: Manages and versions large datasets and machine learning models, ensuring reproducibility and streamlined data pipelines.
- **Git Integration**: For source code management and version control, making the project easily maintainable and scalable.
- **MLOps Practices**: Incorporates best practices in machine learning operations to automate workflows, from data preparation to model deployment.
- **DagsHub Integration**: Facilitates collaboration, data and model versioning, experiment tracking, and more in a user-friendly platform.
